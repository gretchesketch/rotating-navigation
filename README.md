When you click on the menu button icon it should trigger an affect that slides the screen form the top left corner in a diaginal direction up, revealing the "Home", "About", "Contact" dummy links. it also reveals the close button and gives the appearance that the menu bars twisted on the circle off the screen much the same way the close button twisted on the screen.

when you click the x button it should slide the page back to its normal veiwpoint and once again conceal the menu options and the close button as well.
