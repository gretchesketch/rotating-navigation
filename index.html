                    <h3>My Alien Lord and Conqueror</h3>

                    <p>Morbo the Annihilator, born spetember 5th 2971, is one of the little known species of yellow-eyed aliens with gigantic heads, the husband of Fawn, and the father of her numerous belligerent offspring. He is also a widely known television presenter. Morbo started as a reporter in Los Angeles, and now co-hosts several shows on Channel âˆš2, most prominently, the news, with Linda van Schoonhoven, with whom he maintains a relationship that is at least odd.

                        A violent alien and a good friend of President Richard Nixon, he is also obsessed with taking over Earth, mentioning it very frequently. Apparently, he is the scout of an impending alien invasion, although it is possible that his evil is just an act used to increase ratings. Morbo always refers to himself in the third person, and his exposed torso is terrifying beyond imagination.</p>
